# About

`merge-pr-to-branch` is a Github action that will manage your deployment branches via pull requests. This removes the need to manually reset/merge/push your deployment branch for testing.

See [Gap Analysis](gap-analysis.md).

## Installation

To enable this github action, run the following in your repo:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deliveroo/merge-pr-to-branch/master/install/install.sh | bash -s
```

Which will add `.github/workflows/merge-pr-to-branch.yml` to your repo, based on the contents of [this template file](./install/workflow.yml). This will use [the defaults](./action.yml), which will merges any PRs to the `main` branch, that have the `stage` label to the `staging` branch (and then add the `staged` label).

## Use the action

1. To merge a pull request to the `target-branch`, add the `stage` label.
2. `merge-pr-to-branch` will run and attempt to merge the pull request
    * If successful, the `staged` label will be added along with a comment
    * If unsuccessful, a comment with the error will be added and the `stage` label will be removed
